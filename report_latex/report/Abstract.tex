\chapter*{Abstract}

\noindent This project activity report is intended to explain the approach used in solving a Data Mining competition held on the \textit{Kaggle} platform. In particular, the competition goes under the name "\textit{LANL Earthquake Prediction}", and the major issue that the participants are asked to solve is to predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur, given real-time seismic data. The challenge is hosted by \textit{Los Alamos National Laboratory} and has its ultimate goal in having the possibility to scale the results to the field, to be finally able to improve real earthquakes predictions.

The work hereby presented has its roots in Los Alamos' initial work, a first model built on laboratory experimental data. With reference to the initial data, the dataset provided for the challenge contains much more a-periodic occurrences of earthquakes, making it more realistic and comparable to real world occurrences.

The report will present the reader with an in-depth analysis of the problem and the provided data, followed by a first na{\"i}ve approach to better understand the nature of the problem, and finally a comparison of the performances of various techniques for modeling the specific problem.
